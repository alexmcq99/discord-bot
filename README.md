# discord-bot
Making a youtube/spotify music bot for personal discord server

## Set up development environment

Do the following steps to set up your dev environment to run the discord bot:
1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) if not already installed
2. Create a conda environment from `discord_bot_env.yml`

    `conda create -f discord_bot.yml`

    This will create a new conda environment called `discord_bot_env` containing all necessary packages.
3. Activate the conda environment

    After these steps, your dev environment should be good to go.
